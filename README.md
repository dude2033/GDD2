# GDD2

Git workflow:

Branch from develop branch into your own feature branch. Fuck around as much as you want until feature is done. Create a Pull request for develop branch. Get someone else to approve your pull request. DO NOT APPROVE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST!
The Develop branch will be merged into the master branch for Milestones or Deadlines only.
